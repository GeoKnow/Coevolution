Coevolution
===========

This component implements the GeoKnow Co-Evolution Services (Task T4.3). They are provided as a Java WAR, but can also be run as a standalone jar with built-in Jetty application server. For further documentation, see the deliverable 4.3.1 at http://geoknow.eu/Deliverables.html .

For legal reasons, this repository contains the interfaces (coevolution-core module) and the binaries (as WAR file). The source code is managed in a private repository.

##Building

Not applicable.

##Starting

Copy the WAR file to your local application server's webapp directory. Start the server and see, e.g.,

	http://localhost:8080/coevolution-service/
